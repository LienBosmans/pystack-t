PyStack't will become a Python package based on [Stack't](https://github.com/LienBosmans/stack-t). 

While Stack't is a proof-of-concept on how to embed the data transformations needed for object-centric process mining into an (existing) data stack, 
PyStack't will expose some of the available functionality in a more stable and user-friendly format.
