PyStack't (`pystackt`) will become a Python package based on [Stack't](https://github.com/LienBosmans/stack-t). 

While Stack't is a proof-of-concept on how to embed the data transformations needed for object-centric process mining into an (existing) data stack, it's not very user-friendly for ad-hoc use.
PyStack't exposes some of its functionality in a Python package.
